here i have used header tags ,and inside the header tag there are two containers one for my main navbar and other one is the bar bellow the navbar,which i named under-navbar.
for the navbar i used various html tags like select,img,input,anchor tags,ul tags,and button also i have used fonts like the magnifying glass  and the cart  from fontawesome.
and css used for this section are flex,align items,justify content,background-color,height and width. i have used flex for many elements here.also i have used the hover selector on my elements so that if i hover on the icons the cursor would change to pointer.i have also used font-size ,border radius,border,text-decoration and margin properties.

here i used section tags inside which which the image is held,and i have given a id to it "offer-image".i added the image in css using background-image property.i also used various other css property to fit the image properly inside the container like background-size,background-position,and background repeat.

in this section i have used section tags inside which i created four divs to contain the elements and gave the section an id of grid.
i also used flex here,with other flex properties like align-items,justify content,flex-wrap and space-evanely.i used css transition here to make the grid elements to create a zoom in and out kind of  effect when i hover on it.
i have used properties like transition and transform when i hover on it. also used different other css properties like margin,text-decoration,height,width etc.

so finally in my footer section i used footer tags inside which i created multiple  divs,to store my elements. i created a "back-to-top" bar so that if i click on it,it should take me to first content of my page. i acheived that by creating a anchor element inside my div and given the anchor element href set to the id of my first content which is the navbar.
